**SHOP PRODUCT FINDER**

**About**:This is an App that shows a customer if a particular grocery shop has a particular product they want to buy. It comprises of a customer interface, admin and inventory interface. It has Frontend of HTML, Javascript, Boothstrap and Css and a Backend of Flask and mysql database. The customer registers/logs in, finds the product they wish to buy and the shops that have the product. It also shows the customer the closest shop to get the product. The admin also uses it to know which products that need restocking.

**Target User Groups**: The main Target group are the customers, followed by the sellers

**The Problem**: Many atimes we need a product but we do not know the particular shop to buy it from. We end up going to several shops and sometimes giving up before getting to the particular shop. This problem mainly arise when we do not want to order these goods online as a result of urgency or as a result of need to see, touch and examine the product from a closer perspective. E.g, I remember moving to 3 different shops looking for Peanut butter before finding it afetr 3 hours. I also asked a group of 6 students in Pfarrkirchen who said their biggest shopping challenge is knowing the shops that have what they want. The challenge of transporting themselves takes their time. Two of them said they have resorted to online ordering where the products take even more time to arrive. 

**Solution**: This App helps a customer know the exact shop to find the product they want. It also helps them know the closest one to find it.

**Market Analysis**: This App will greatly replace online ordering as it saves the customer time, cost of movement and energy. Also it satisfies customer need to see, feel and examine the product. I see this App being a great success.
